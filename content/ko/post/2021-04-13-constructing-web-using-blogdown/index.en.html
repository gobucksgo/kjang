<p>It is not easy to construct web pages using blogdown.</p>
<p>After setting everything for web pages, I struggled with putting new post in R markdown format because there is nothing changed in the web page.</p>
<p>It takes long time to figure out the reason why. There was no index.html file until Knit the rmd file.</p>
<p>There was no explaination in the documents I refered so far.</p>
<p>Now, everything is going well.</p>
