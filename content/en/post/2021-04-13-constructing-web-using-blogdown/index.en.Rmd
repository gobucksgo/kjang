It is not easy to construct web pages using blogdown.

After setting everything for web pages, I struggled with putting new post in R markdown format because there is nothing changed in the web page.

It takes long time to figure out the reason why. There was no index.html file until Knit the rmd file.

There was no explaination in the documents I refered so far.

Now, everything is going well.
